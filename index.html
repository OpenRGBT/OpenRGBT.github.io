          Semantic segmentation is a critical technique for effective scene understanding. 
          Traditional RGB-T semantic segmentation models often struggle to generalize across 
          diverse scenarios due to their reliance on pretrained models and predefined 
          categories. Recent advancements in Visual Language Models (VLMs) have facilitated 
          a shift from closed-set to open-vocabulary semantic segmentation methods. 
          However, these models face challenges in dealing with intricate scenes, primarily 
          due to the heterogeneity between RGB and thermal modalities. To address this gap, 
          we present Open-RGBT, a novel open-vocabulary RGB-T semantic segmentation model. 
          Specifically, we obtain instance-level detection proposals by incorporating visual 
          prompts to enhance category understanding. Additionally, we employ the CLIP model to 
          assess image-text similarity, which helps correct semantic consistency and mitigates 
          ambiguities in category identification. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that 
          Open-RGBT achieves superior performance in diverse and challenging real-world 
          scenarios, even in the wild, significantly advancing the field of RGB-T semantic segmentation.
